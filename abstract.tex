\section*{Abstract}
The following paper tries to define the effects of a destination based cash flow tax on exchange rates under the assumption of border tax adjustment neutrality. I assume that the tax imposing country is the US, with the Dollar as the home currency, and its only trading partner is the E.U., with the foreign currency Euro. The destination based cash flow tax is not a newly introduced tax, but rather a reform that border adjusts the existing current corporate profit tax (CPT).
